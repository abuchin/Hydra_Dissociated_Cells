Hi Anatoly!
Thank you very much for your email. Yes, I am definitely happy that this paper is out :)
 
Sure. I attached a file with that data. When you open it with Excel, column C is the 
neuron number, column H is the frame number, column E is the x coordinate and column 
F is the y coordinate. I'm using Excel terminology because I don't want to create any 
confusion as to whether the first column is column 0 or 1â€¦
 
The picture that's in the Figure that you attached corresponds to frame 200.
 
Please let me know if anything is not clear.
 
See you later this afternoon!
Chris

Hi Anatoly,
I just figured out that you also need this info.
The document 20140829NeuronIdentity indicates to which group each neuron belongs. Column A is neuron number and column B is its identity, where:
1 = RP1
2 = RP2
3 = CB
4-8 = other.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Chris
