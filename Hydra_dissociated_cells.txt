Cell body size (it is the only metric we have!)
Charlie told me that  a cell body is roughly 8 μm and he suggested to estimate the length
 of the nerve processes by using this value. 
 
Pixel size 
 The answer to the first question is that maceration is highly possible that cuts the 
 neurites and the mounting on the slide could cause the folding.
 About the pixel size there are some difficulties to answer that accurately.
 We used phase contrast microscope with 40x objective but we didn't pay attention to the 
 configuration. We estimate that the pixel size is 0,22μm based on the size of the cell
  body of the neurites which is 8-15μm . The images which are attached show the procedure.
